# # Week 3
# # This week we will work on :
# # Working With Strings


# # 1.   Working With Numbers
# # 2.   Getting Input From Users




# # 1.   Building a Basic Calculator
# # 2.   Mad Libs Game




































# # Review
# create variables for the following :
# 1. age
# 2. name
# 3. song
# 4. food
# 5. number
age = 27 #integer variable
name = "Daniel" #String variable
song ="Smells like teen spirit"
food = "Tacos"
number = 176

# #now include the variables you just made print in the following...


# Once upon a time, there was a [age] old coder named [name].


# [name] liked to hum the song [song] while coding. It was so annoying that their teammates would throw [food] until [name] would stop singing.


# Still, [name] was the best coder on the team and could write [number] lines of code every day. Maybe [song] was [name]â€™s secret power?

# The names you use when creating these labels need to follow a few rules:
# 1. Names can not start with a number.
# 2. There can be no spaces in the name, use _ instead.
# 3. Can't use any of these symbols :'",<>/?|\()!@#$%^&*~-+
# 4. It's considered best practice (PEP8) that names are lowercase.
# 5. Avoid using the characters 'l' (lowercase letter el), 'O' (uppercase letter oh),
#    or 'I' (uppercase letter eye) as single character variable names.
# 6. Avoid using words that have special meaning in Python like "list" and "str"


# Here are some exercises to practice the rules:


# Correcting Invalid Names: Below are some invalid names. Correct them according to the rules:


# first_name
# last_name
# email_address
# percent
# variable_name
# zero
# list # this is a key word in python
# you cannot use it for your own vairable name
# Creating Valid Names: Create valid names for the following descriptions:


# The first name of a person
# The last name of a person
# The email address of a person
# The percentage of marks obtained by a student
# A variable to store the number of items in a shopping cart




# Identify Valid and Invalid Names: Identify which of the following names are valid or invalid according to the rules:


# first_name
# lastName
# email_address
# percentage
# variable_name
# one_variable
# email_address
# percentage
# integer

# # **Working with** **numbers** **bold text**
# We'll learn about the following topics:
# 1. Types of Numbers in Python
# 2. Basic Arithmetic
# 3. Differences between classic division and floor division


# Python has various "types" of numbers (numeric literals).
# 1. We'll mainly focus on integers and floating point numbers.
# Integers are just whole numbers, positive or negative. For example: 2 and -2 are examples of integers.
# 2. Floating point numbers in Python are notable because they have a decimal point in them, or use an exponential (e) to define the number. For example 2.0 and -2.1 are examples of floating point numbers. 4E2 (4 times 10 to the power of 2) is also an example of a floating point number in Python.

# #addition
print(2+1)
# #multiplication
print(2*2)
# #division
print(6/2)
# #modulo
print(7%4) #remainder of 7 divided by 4
# #powers
print(2**3) #2 to the number of 3
# #get the max and min of a number
print("the max of 2 and 3 is",max(2,3))
#max means the highest number
print("the min of 2 and 3 is" ,min(2,3))
#min means lowest number
# #round a number
print("round 3.9 is" , round(3.9))
# # absolute value
print("the absolute value of -3 is" , abs(-3))
# # order of operations
print("2 + 10 * 10 + 3 is" , 2+10*10+3)
#it means do the multiplication first
# then do the addition

# #to do more you need to import special math libraries from python
from math import *
# #this goes out and grabs some different math functions we can use
# #floor method
print("the floor of 3.7 is" , floor(3.7))
#floor means round down
# #ceil method
print("the ceil of 3.7 is" ,ceil(3.7))

print("the floor of 5.6 is ",floor(5.6))
print("the ceil of 5.6 is" ,ceil(5.6))

#ceil means round up
# #sqrt method

# So what have we learned? We learned some of the basics of numbers in Python. We also learned how to do arithmetic and use Python as a basic calculator. We then wrapped it up with learning about Variable Assignment in Python.
# # **Getting Input from users**
# #how do we get input from users?
# input("what is your name?")

name = input("what is your name")
print("Hello " +name)
# # basic math calculator
# #ask the user for 2 numbers
num1 = int(input("enter a number"))
num2 = int(input("enter another number"))

# # print out a statement where you:
# # add them together

print(num1 + num2)
# #multiply
print(num1 * num2)
# # find the max number
print(max(num1,num2))
# # find the remainder of the numbers
print(num1 % num2)
# #round one number
print(round(num1))

numb1 = int(input("Enter a number"))
numb2 = int(input("Enter another number"))
print("Number 1 and  Number 2  subtracted is" , numb1-numb2)
print("Number 1 and Number 2 divided is" , numb1/numb2)
print("The minimum of Number 1 and Number 2 is" , min(numb1,numb2))
print("The absolute value of Number 1 is ", abs(numb1))
print("The floor of Number 1 is ", floor(numb1))
print("The ceil of Number 1 is ", ceil(numb1))
print("The square root of number 1 is" , sqrt(numb1))
